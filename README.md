# CLT-Land-Map
This tool is for help land brokers and investors identify land opportunities that are in the path of progress and have high demand. First, the tool will be built to identify infill land locations by finding sites without buildings on them. This will be cross referenced with the UDO Development standards and Zoning requirements to identify which opportunities are immediate and which ones will require entitlement work.
Second, this tool will target large parcels (min 5 AC) that can be subdividing into smaller parcels.
